Welcome to the README of **Machine Learning: Image Classification**. 

## The Dataset 📈
This repository uses dataset available [here](https://github.com/dicodingacademy/assets/releases/download/release/rockpaperscissors.zip). 

## The Devs ✒️
This repository is developed as Final Assignment of **Belajar Machine Learning untuk Pemula** module, a part of **Data Science** learning path of **Dicoding** awarded by IDCamp 2023. 

## The Problems 📝
This repository is focusing on these following bulletpoints:
* Data split : 60% train and 40% validation
* Commencing image augmentation
* Utilizing Image Data Generator
* Developing sequential model
* Training duration not more than 30 minutes
* 85% of minimum accuracy
* Able to precisely predict loaded image

## The Libraries 📚
* `numpy` library to carry out numerical computation such as sets, arrays, multidimension matrixes, and vectors
* `pandas` library to undergo data processing, analysing, and manipulation using dataframe
* `matplotlib` library to perform visualization using plotting
* `os` library to execute loading data
* `zipfile` library to extract file
* `skicit learn` library to split dataset
* `tensorflow` library to generate image
* `keras` library to displaying image
